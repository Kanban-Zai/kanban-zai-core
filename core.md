Document source url: https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/

## WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI

Kanban-Zai enables execution teams to "Fail Fast", "Adapt Fast" and move forward with objectivity.

## WHY KANBAN-ZAI

If you want to build scalable teams that are local or remote, enhance productivity and genuinely enrich the 
lives of everybody involved then Kanban-Zai is for you.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

* TRUST 
* CONSENSUS
* FEEDBACK
* DISCIPLINE

## GETTING STARTED

It is probably not worth implementing any form of management process if you are 3 or less in a team, but if your team 
has outside influences in any form it's probably worth considering.

There are some core immutable principles your team need to take on-board, without which you are not doing Kanban-Zai.

  * VISIBILITY  - this is an important factor in trust, consenus and feedback.  However you communicate, what needs to 
                  be achieved should be visible to all team members.  There should be one source of truth for the work 
                  ahead.  This means no personal task lists.
  * OBJECTIVITY - Personal opinion does not matter.  A consensus of opinions does.
  * EVIDENCE    - There should be evidence compelling the team to start a peice of work and evidence to compel the team
                  to cease that peice of work.
  * PRIORITY    - All things can be done as long as they are prioritized.  When deadlines are required priority defines
                  what is descoped.
  * CONSISTENCY - 
  * RESPECT -
  * TEAM NORMS  - Your team's standard operational settings.

## EXTEND

The formal process for extending Kanban-Zai is by running a deviation. This is the one and only meeting Kanban-Zai 
enforces.  Run monthly, unless there is 100% consensus against it.  You dont have to change settings in a deviation
but it provides a regular opportunity for anyone to do so.  

Via a deviation you may change the team Norms and settings.


## THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Planning Team     - Responsible for taking a concept and creating a backlog of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.

### The Vision Team

Primarily comprises of the Client, End Users, Product Owner.

As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other
way around.  It also does not work that well when the feet both walk and lead.

The vision team must have a clear view of what they want and create the path that the team will follow.

### The Planning Team
Primarily comprised of the product owner, Design, UX, IA, BA, Testers, Security Advisor

Another saying goes the best laid plans of mice and men...refering to how plans can go wrong
But you actually have to have a plan.  Thats where this team comes in.

### The Execution Team
Primarily comprised of developers, testers, dev ops, security advisors.

There is no measure of velocity in Kanban-Zai. The execution team takes work from the 
backlog in t-shirt sized chunks.  There is a measure of tense in Kanban-Zai.  Tense is used in the same way as it is 
normally used past tense, future tense.  At the start of a project the whole team will be working "Past Tense".  
The goal being to move to "Future Tense".

### Sprints
One week sprints are strictly enforced in Kanban-Zai.  This is because there is no velocity measure.  So instead we
use 1 week as a yard stick.  The idea is to take only what you can finish in one sprint.  Finish it an then move onto 
the next.  Biting of a little chunk at a time.  Of course in practice this requires skills that almost nobody has.  

Formally you do not have to finish the chunk of work you pickup in a week, but continually improve your card writing 
until you do.  The way this happens is this.  By using 1 week as a measure, when you get to the end of one week, take
what ever work you have not completed and transfer it to another card to be played next week.  Then rewrite the
current card to accuratley represent what has been done.  This is now what will be tested and delivered.  Repeat this
process every week.

Overtime the goal is to improve the individual and team ability to write execution cards.  The two primary areas to 
focus on when writing cards are, as in agile, value and comprehension.  In Kanban-Zai there is another factor to 
consider. "Value over time", this happens naturally in Kanban-Zai because of the 1 week sprint enforcement however
the time tense must eventually be changed to "Future tense".  At this point predictions can begin to be made about 
delivery times.  Tense is not a Kanban-Zai setting and the tense will be different on different parts of your project.
Tese just acknowledges where you are in your thinking and actions around a particular part of your project.  If your 
project is small you are likley to only refer the entire project tense, on a bigger project, different aspects will
have different tenses.  It is important to know tht predictions about delivery can only be made when you are working
in "Future Tense".

### Scaling
    Pairing
    Parallelism


## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Don't do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve 
everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense, for example, a deviation allows you to 
introduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospectively.
