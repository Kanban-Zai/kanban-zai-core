# THE KANBAN-ZAI PROTOCOL ( VERSION 2 | QAPLA')
Document source url: https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/

## WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI

Kanban-Zai enables collaboration teams to "Fail Fast", "Adapt Fast" and move forward with objectivity.

## WHY KANBAN-ZAI

If you want to build scalable teams that are local or remote, enhance productivity and genuinely enrich the 
lives of everybody involved then Kanban-Zai is for you.

## BENEFITS

The main benefit of Kanban-Zai to all is a team who's every action is based on facts and evidence and consensus rather 
than personal bias.  In other words Objectivity.

###FOR EMPLOYERS
* Increase your available talent pool.
* Fit Kanban-Zai to your business.
* Kanban-Zai does not change or dictate your internal processes.

###FOR EMPLOYEES
* Immediate familiarity with process.
* 
* 

## GETTING STARTED

To get started, just choose to implement Kanban-Zai.  Run with the default settings for a while.  See how it goes. if
you need to change something then run a deviation meeting and extend your implementation.

## EXTEND

The formal process for extending Kanban-Zai is by running a deviation. This is the one and only meeting Kanban-Zai 
enforces.  Run monthly, unless there is a full consensus against it.  You dont have to change settings in a deviation
but it provides a regular opportunity for anyone to do so.  

Via a deviation you may change the team Norms and settings.

## THE PYRAMID OF PRINCIPLES

The principles of Kanban-Zai are a pyramid with objectivity at the peak.

                                OBJECTIVITY
                         TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
       VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY

Collaboration can be a very subjective world as it brings together people from, many, different walks of life.  
Different people have different ideas.  It is very easy for personal bias to creep into any process and objectivity
suffers.  If objectivity suffers you can just flip the pyramid upside down to see what happens. 

       VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY
                         TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
                                OBJECTIVITY  <---- Crumbling objectivity = A bad day for everyone

Objectivity, as well as all the other principles, must be constantly maintained.  Lose one, lose all.

                                
## THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Planning Team     - Responsible for taking a concept and creating a backlog of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.

### The Vision Team

Primarily comprises of the Client, End Users, Product Owner.

As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other
way around.  It also does not work that well when the feet both walk and lead.

The vision team must have a clear view of what they want and create the path that the team will follow.

### The Planning Team
Primarily comprised of the product owner, Design, UX, IA, BA, Testers, Security Advisor

Another saying goes the best laid plans of mice and men...refering to how plans can go wrong
But you actually have to have a plan.  Thats where this team comes in.

### The Execution Team
Primarily comprised of developers, testers, dev ops, security advisors.

There is no measure of velocity in Kanban-Zai. The execution team takes work from the 
backlog in t-shirt sized chunks.  There is a measure of tense in Kanban-Zai.  Tense is used in the same way as it is 
normally used past tense, future tense.  At the start of a project the whole team will be working "Past Tense".  
The goal being to move to "Future Tense".

### Sprints
One week sprints are strictly enforced in Kanban-Zai.  This is because there is no velocity measure.  So instead we
use 1 week as a yard stick.  The idea is to take only what you can finish in one sprint.  Finish it an then move onto 
the next.  Biting of a little chunk at a time.  Of course in practice this requires skills that almost nobody has.  

Formally you do not have to finish the chunk of work you pickup in a week, but continually improve your card writing 
until you do.  The way this happens is this.  By using 1 week as a measure, when you get to the end of one week, take
what ever work you have not completed and transfer it to another card to be played next week.  Then rewrite the
current card to accuratley represent what has been done.  This is now what will be tested and delivered.  Repeat this
process every week.

Overtime the goal is to improve the individual and team ability to write execution cards.  The two primary areas to 
focus on when writing cards are, as in agile, value and comprehension.  In Kanban-Zai there is another factor to 
consider. "Value over time", this happens naturally in Kanban-Zai because of the 1 week sprint enforcement however
the time tense must eventually be changed to "Future tense".  At this point predictions can begin to be made about 
delivery times.  Tense is not a Kanban-Zai setting and the tense will be different on different parts of your project.
Tese just acknowledges where you are in your thinking and actions around a particular part of your project.  If your 
project is small you are likley to only refer the entire project tense, on a bigger project, different aspects will
have different tenses.  It is important to know tht predictions about delivery can only be made when you are working
in "Future Tense".

### Scaling
    Pairing
    Parallelism


## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Don't do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve 
everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense, for example, a deviation allows you to 
introduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospectively.
