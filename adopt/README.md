To adopt Kanban-Zai create a github repo and include the kanban-zai.yaml template within
the repo.  You must have this file in your repo to say you are running a Kanban-Zai team

The YAML file must contain all top level properties.  The top level properties may not be renamed
or removed.  

Currently these properties are as follows.

* version
* settings
* sanctions
* feedback
