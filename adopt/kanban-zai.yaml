      name: norm-sanctions
      status: default
      modifiable: false
      required: true
      description: A sanction is not a punishment or a reward.  It is a record of a team member deviating from the team
        norms or going out of bounds of a card or breaking the bounds of Kanban-Zai in some fashion.
        This is neither a good or bad thing by itself.  For example many experienced developers break protocol all the
        time as do many inexperienced developers.  Additionally maybe your team requires someone like this or really
        wants to run a tight ship.  As a team you are required to record sanctions, but only with a QUORUM. It should
        never be recorded why a team member is working for you currently or no longer working for you.

      status: default
      modifiable: false
      required: true
      description: In many cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know
      what you dont know sometimes.  However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change
      something about the card.  Record this change, split out new cards or combine existing ones.  The goal of
      backporting is for the card to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.

      represents when a team member, for any reason, deviated from the restrictions of Kanban-Zai.  All team members
      past and present must be recorded. It should never be recorded in here why a team member is working for you
      currently or no longer working for you.
