# THE KANBAN-ZAI PROTOCOL.  VERSION 2. - This page is unfinished
Document source url: https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/

## GETTING STARTED

To get started, create a github repo.  It doesn't particularly have to be github but it must be public
and hosted by a 3rd party.

Create a file called kanban-zai.yaml and Use the kanban-zai.yaml in this project as a starter template. This yaml file 
contains sensible defaults for your team.

Congratulations you are now practicing Kanban-Zai.

## HOW IT WORKS

once you have created your Kanban-Zai.yaml and published it to a public repo you are "doing Kanban-Zai".

The next step is to run a deviation and choose the settings and team norms you want to start your team with.


## EXTEND

The formal process for extending Kanban-Zai is by running a deviation. This is the one and only meeting Kanban-Zai 
enforces.  Run it based on the setting in the Kanban-Zai file.

Via a deviation you may change the team Norms and settings.

## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Don't do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve 
everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense, for example, a deviation allows you to 
introduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospectively.  You dont have to change settings in a deviation but it provides a
 regular opportunity for anyone to do so.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: A deviation must be run regularly with the maximum time allowed between deviations being 3 monthly.  You
                must run a deviation a minimum of 4 times per year to keep your Kanban-Zai status active.
