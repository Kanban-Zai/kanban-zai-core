# THE KANBAN-ZAI CORE.  VERSION 2. - This page is unfinished

The core of Kanban-Zai is the yaml configuration file.  This must be held in a public repo and must track all changes
from the day it was implemented.  Deviations from this are not allowed.

The first this you should note about the config file are the settings and team norms.  The settings seek to constrain
certain behaviours and the norms seek to guide behaviour patterns.

Any team member who feels they disaggree with the constraint or the norms and chooses not to be bound by them, even for
1 single instance, must be sanctioned.  

It is important to note a sanction is not a punishment and no action other than a sanction should be taken.  A protest
may also be raised by the person being sanctioned.  Again this is just a record of an event happening and not a signal
to take remedial action in the traditional sense.

If a team refuses to rasie a sanction a pull request may be added to the official Kanban-Zai yaml file and a protest 
raised there.

Additionally, any individual may maintain their own Kanban-Zai yaml file and sanction or protest there.

## KANBAN-ZAI.YAML

This file contains all information about your project, or you as an individual.  From the perspective of a team it is
how they operate and from the perspective of an individual it is how they personally like to operate.

kanban-Zai is a microservice at heart and this file may be aggregated by anyone

## SETTINGS


## NORMS
 

## EXTEND

The formal process for extending Kanban-Zai is by running a deviation. This is the one and only meeting Kanban-Zai 
enforces.  Run it based on the setting in the Kanban-Zai file.

Via a deviation you may change the team Norms and settings.

## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Don't do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve 
everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense, for example, a deviation allows you to 
introduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospectively.  You dont have to change settings in a deviation but it provides a
 regular opportunity for anyone to do so.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: A deviation must be run regularly with the maximum time allowed between deviations being 3 monthly.  You
                must run a deviation a minimum of 4 times per year to keep your Kanban-Zai status active.
