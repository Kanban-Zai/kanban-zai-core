# UNDERSTANDING THE VISION - This page is unfinished

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  

Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Scheduling Team     - Responsible for maintaining the schedule of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.

## The Vision Team

The role of the vision team is to manifest the clients vision into relevance.

 Every client has a winning idea, and even if that was true some winning ideas win more than others.  Sometimes other
 ideas that are not as good do better at market.
 
 This is the primary question the vision team must ask.  Is the idea viable?
  
 The actual answer to that question does not matter.  Because more often than not the idea itself is not even fully 
 formed.  It is the job of the vision team to fully realize the idea. 
 

## Client requests

Client requests must be answered and there are only 3 answers a team can really give.

* Yes - there is no evidential or experiential reason this request wont achieve its goal.
* Urge not to - There is evidence or experience to suggest that this request will only achieve partial success
* Strongly Urge not to - There is evidence or experience to suggest this request will not achieve the desired outcome

## Method

Dur

A
by biting off chunks of the idea and 
producing [epics](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/exposition/what-are-epics.ms) 


 
The time spent doing this is determined by the [PREDICTION SETTING](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/extensions/setting-predictions.md) but the method is the same.

This process must consider 3 things.

1. The Technology
2. The Business Model
3. The Zeitgeist
 
### Technology
This is less actual technology and more capability. Sometimes we are talking tech, sometimes it could be a 100 monkeys
locked in a room with typewriters.  Both are a form of automation, both provide a capability, both are scalable,
both require no extrodinary special skill on the part of the business entity.  All that matters is what can be done and
what cannot be done and how that fits the business model and the market.

### The Business Model
Plain and simple. How is this idea going to be monetized.

### The Zeitgeist
Meaning the ghost of the times it is made up of things like Market Fit, Public Appitite for the idea, The Problem 
being solved and other subjective ideas.
 
## The Golden Halo

If you imagine these 3 ideas represented by a Zen Diagram.  Inside each ring of the diagram you write the pros
and cons of the idea based on the ring they are in.  Will the market accept the idea, is the market desperate for it,
where will the technology break down, will the business model constrain the technology?  All these things must be 
considered and arranged into the diagram.  Negatives push the rings apart and positives pull the rings together.  If
all 3 rings align exactly ontop of one another then you have achieved the GOLDEN HALO and you are onto a guaranteed winner.

More often than not this will not happen and you will now be considering..."The Zen Diagram of fuckedness"

        [ PICTURE OF THE ZEN DIAGRAM OF FUCKEDNESS ]
        
                      Business model --- Technology
                                  Zeitgeist

The viable part of your idea sits at the intersection of the 3 rings.  The larger the intersection the more viable the 
idea.  The goal is to make that intersection as large as possible and fit as much in there as possible THAT IS RELEVANT
to the idea at hand.  Only this way can you get a clear picture.

Of course the Z.D.O.F is a communication concept rather than a magical measuring tool.  Discovering the viability and
realizing and idea are a hard problem that generally requires multiple collaborators.  Do not minimise lightly this part
 of the process.  
 
As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other way around. 

### Descoping.
At this point there will be a product starting to form.  To build an epic you must now winnow it down to just the 
important parts and remove everthing that is not important.

Budget must also be managed as part of the vision.  Epics must be assigned budgets and both aggreed with the client 
before handing off to the scheduling team.  At this point only a ballpark figure should be set on the amount of time
it will take to execute this epic.  There also should be no delivery date aggreed but a priority of 1-3 should be set.

### Definition of done

## Lead time: 12 weeks
    
    How far in advance should the vision team speculate?
