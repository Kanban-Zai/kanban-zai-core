# INTRODUCTION - This page is unfinished
It is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it, are able 
to do so.

# DESCRIPTION

There is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  It is important to understand that the 
purpose of Kanban-Zai is not to dictate to a team about how they should act and behave.  Adopting Kanban-Zai should not 
impose a cultural change upon your team.  You work how you work, you like what you like.  Kanban-Zai should be thought 
of as the glue that binds different parts of the puzzle together and most importantly Kanban-Zai attempts to present an 
objective perspective to all members of the team.

## SETTINGS

* todo-lists: forbidden


## NORMS


### NOT-HOGWARTS -  You are not harry potter and this is not hogwarts and Kanban-Zai is NOT magic.

It is the humans that provide the power to the process.  They can only do that if individual efforts are 
collectively, focused through the lens of the process.  Said another way, team members must WANT to be working on 
a Kanban-Zai team.



### VIBING  - enjoy each others company

This norm is not here to tell you how to vibe with others.  It is here to tell you how you dont.
    - sincerity
    - no organized spontaneity
    - dont be a dick

### OPINION - you must have one, to be involve in decision making in any meaningful way.
   
Your VOICE matters to the team, that is why you are there!  No team can function without information.  The only place a 
team can get expert information from is other team members.  That's actually the whole point of a team.  
   
Therefore All team members must offer up information, in the form of opinions.
   
A balance must be struck however, because when a team has members who have an existing rapport the information exchange 
between them can be very high, however other members of the team may not get the same amount of information from the 
exact same conversation.  Conversely, new team members may be saying a lot but not relaying much information to anyone
or worse may be going over ground everybody just covered.  
   
The ultimate outcome of any information flow throughout the team is consensus and consensus cannot be said to have been
reached if some voting participants don't know what they are voting for.
