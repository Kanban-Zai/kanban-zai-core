# INTRODUCTION - This page is unfinished
It is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it, are able 
to do so.

# DESCRIPTION
There is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  It is important to understand that the 
purpose of Kanban-Zai is not to dictate to a team about how they should act and behave.  Adopting Kanban-Zai should not 
impose a cultural change upon your team.  You work how you work, you like what you like.  Kanban-Zai should be thought 
of as the glue that binds different parts of the puzzle together and most importantly Kanban-Zai attempts to present an 
objective perspective to all members of the team.

## Vibing - enjoy each other's company.

    - sincerity
    - no organized spontaneity
    - dont be a dick
    
There are things the team can do to smooth the path for interpersonal relationships.  These things are designed to move
the pressure of subjective expectation and begin moving it towards something objective that everyone can aggree on.

## Follow The Process

The Kanban-Zai process can be thought of as a cybernetic algorithm.  It is a process that lets
computers do the things they are good at and humans do the things that they are good at.  One should not mess 
with the other

## You are not harry potter and this is not hogwarts and Kanban-Zai is NOT magic.

It is the humans that provide the power to the process.  They can only do that if individual efforts are 
collectively, focused through the lens of the process.  Said another way, team members must WANT to be working on 
a Kanban-Zai team.

## People are people

People fail, are unreliable, don't communicate well, feel they are not up to the task, like to blame others, make
mistakes, do things wrong, have lives outside the team and are not robots.  So what. Get used to it, and extend 
your teams adoption of Kanban-Zai to accomodate the quirks of your current team.  If your team changes, you may have
 to modify your implementation.

## Your opinion does not matter.  At All.

Your VOICE on the other hand matters a-lot!  No team can function without information.  The only place a team can get 
expert information from is other team members.  That's actually the whole point of a team.  

Therefore All team members must offer up information.  

A balance must be struck however, because when a team has members who have an existing rapport the information exchange 
between them can be very high, however other members of the team may not get the same amount of information from the 
exact same conversation.  Conversely, new team members may be saying a lot but not relaying much information to anyone
 or worse may be going over ground everybody just covered.  

The ultimate outcome of any information flow throughout the team is consensus and consensus cannot be said to have been
reached if some voting participants don't know what they are voting for.

## Make all sources of information accessible

A team must work hard on this aspect of culture. Otherwise all team members are not equal participants in the team and
it is very important that all members have equal standing.  Some may be less experienced with the subject matter or
less skilled in some aspect of the project or have entirely different skills than others.  Or they might speak French.

Regardless they must all have access to the same information, the same reasoning, the same goal set, as everyone else.

This is fairly easy to achieve with code, processes and documentation but much harder if the information is in different
brains.  Therefore private list of jobs are expressly forbidden in Kanban-Zai
