#PROCESS - This page is unfinished

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Planning Team     - Responsible for taking a concept and creating a backlog of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.

## The Vision Team

The role of the vision team is to manifest the clients vision into relevance. 

Every client has a winning idea, and even if that was true some winning ideas win more than others.  Sometimes other
ideas that are not as good do better at market.

This is the primary question the vision team must ask.  Is the idea viable?
 
The actual answer to that question does not matter.  Because more often than not the idea itself is not even fully formed
and it is the job of the vision team to fully realize the idea. 
 
To do this the vision team must consider 3 things.

1. The technology
2. the business model
3. The Zeitgeist
 
### Technology
This is less actual technology and more capability. Sometimes we are talking tech, sometimes it could be a 100 monkeys
locked in a room with typewriters.  Both are a form of automation, both provide a capability, both are scalable,
both require no extrodinary special skill on the part of the business entity.  All that matters is what can be done and
what cannot be done and how that fits the business model and the market.

### The Business Model
Plain and simple. How is this idea going to be moneytized

### The Zeitgeist
Meaning the ghost of the times it is made up of things like Market Fit, Public Appitite, Problem being solved,
and other subjective ideas.


 takes the raw idea from the client and outputs epics.  

The process through which this happens is
the process that protects the team from the outside world.

Epics are the clients vision realized over time. Each epic has an approximate budget and an approximate build order 
aggreed with the client.
 

Not all ideas are equal and each must be balanced against many things

                      Business model --- Technology
                                  Zeitgeist

This is known as the Zen diagram of Fuckedness.  Your idea  sits at the center of the 3 circles.  The larger
the intersection the more viable the idea.

Budget,  

If the technology can do all the business model requires and the zeitgeist fits the technology and the business 
model then things are looking good.


Primarily comprises of the Client, End Users, Product Owner.

As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other
way around.  It also does not work that well when the feet both walk and lead.

The vision team must have a clear view of what they want and create the path that the team will follow.

Budget must also be managed as part of the vision


### The Planning Team
Primarily comprised of the product owner, Design, UX, IA, BA, Testers, Security Advisor

Another saying goes the best laid plans of mice and men...refering to how plans can go wrong
But you actually have to have a plan.  Thats where this team comes in.

### The Execution Team
Primarily comprised of developers, testers, dev ops, security advisors.

There is no measure of velocity in Kanban-Zai. The execution team takes work from the 
backlog in t-shirt sized chunks.  There is a measure of tense in Kanban-Zai.  Tense is used in the same way as it is 
normally used past tense, future tense.  At the start of a project the whole team will be working "Past Tense".  
The goal being to move to "Future Tense".

The ability of a team member to split and join cards as needed is a required part of the process.


### Sprints
One week sprints are strictly enforced in Kanban-Zai.  This is because there is no velocity measure.  So instead we
use 1 week as a yard stick.  The idea is to take only what you can finish in one sprint.  Finish it an then move onto 
the next.  Biting of a little chunk at a time.  Of course in practice this requires skills that almost nobody has.  

Formally you do not have to finish the chunk of work you pickup in a week, but continually improve your card writing 
until you do.  The way this happens is this.  By using 1 week as a measure, when you get to the end of one week, take
what ever work you have not completed and transfer it to another card to be played next week.  Then rewrite the
current card to accuratley represent what has been done.  This is now what will be tested and delivered.  Repeat this
process every week.

Overtime the goal is to improve the individual and team ability to write execution cards.  The two primary areas to 
focus on when writing cards are, as in agile, value and comprehension.  In Kanban-Zai there is another factor to 
consider. "Value over time", this happens naturally in Kanban-Zai because of the 1 week sprint enforcement however
the time tense must eventually be changed to "Future tense".  At this point predictions can begin to be made about 
delivery times.  Tense is not a Kanban-Zai setting and the tense will be different on different parts of your project.
Tese just acknowledges where you are in your thinking and actions around a particular part of your project.  If your 
project is small you are likley to only refer the entire project tense, on a bigger project, different aspects will
have different tenses.  It is important to know tht predictions about delivery can only be made when you are working
in "Future Tense".
