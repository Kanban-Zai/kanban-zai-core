#PROCESS - This page is unfinished

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  

Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Scheduling Team     - Responsible for maintaining the schedule of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.
 
## The Execution Team
Primarily comprised of developers, testers, dev ops, security advisors.

There is no measure of velocity in Kanban-Zai. The execution team takes work from the 
backlog in sized chunks.  

There is a measure of tense in Kanban-Zai.  Tense is used in the same way as it is 
normally used past tense, future tense.  At the start of a project the whole team will be working "Past Tense".  
The goal being to move to "Future Tense".

The ability of a team member to split and join cards as needed is a required part of the process.

### Consensus and breaking an impasse.
When the team votes there are 3 types of vote, yes, no and undecided. In a situation where the yes and no votes are even
then the undecided votes are no.

If there are no undecided votes 
* then the product owner may override prodcut decisions.
* the [consensus setting](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/extensions/setting-consensus.md) decides the outcome


### Sprints
One week sprints are strictly enforced in Kanban-Zai.  This is because there is no velocity measure.  So instead we
use 1 week as a yard stick.  The idea is to take only what you can finish in one sprint.  Finish it an then move onto 
the next.  Biting of a little chunk at a time.  Of course in practice this requires skills that almost nobody has.  

Formally you do not have to finish the chunk of work you pickup in a week, but continually improve your card writing 
until you do.  The way this happens is this.  By using 1 week as a measure, when you get to the end of one week, take
what ever work you have not completed and transfer it to another card to be played next week.  Then rewrite the
current card to accuratley represent what has been done.  This is now what will be tested and delivered.  Repeat this
process every week.

Overtime the goal is to improve the individual and team ability to write execution cards.  The two primary areas to 
focus on when writing cards are, as in agile, value and comprehension.  In Kanban-Zai there is another factor to 
consider. "Value over time", this happens naturally in Kanban-Zai because of the 1 week sprint enforcement however
the time tense must eventually be changed to "Future tense".  At this point predictions can begin to be made about 
delivery times.  Tense is not a Kanban-Zai setting and the tense will be different on different parts of your project.
Tese just acknowledges where you are in your thinking and actions around a particular part of your project.  If your 
project is small you are likley to only refer the entire project tense, on a bigger project, different aspects will
have different tenses.  It is important to know tht predictions about delivery can only be made when you are working
in "Future Tense".
