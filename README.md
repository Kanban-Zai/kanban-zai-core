## WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI

Kanban-Zai is a human centric collaboration protocol.  The first release is aimed at software delivery teams (S.D.T), but
in time we hope it will find utility elsewhere also.

It contains 6 modules.

1. core       - Defines the boundries of the team and enforces objectivity.
2. culture    - Defines some cultural boundries inside the team
3. continuity - Provides best practices for maintaining the continuity of knowledge in your team.
4. vision     - the vision.
5. scheduling - schedule.
6. delivery   - execution

You must implement all 6 in version 1 of Kanban-Zai.

## WHY KANBAN-ZAI

These days "Automation" is the mantra of many businesses.  In these times it is easy to forget that it is humans who
are running the show.  Humans do not always gel together as well as they could and are not all at the same level of
knowledge or experience in life.

This last statement is often countered with "My company only hires the best people".   Well.  Assuming the person
saying that believes it to be a truthful statement then the counter question would be "who do google, facebook, apple 
and microsoft have?"

The reality is you probably are not hiring what you consider the best people, and the term "best people" is somewhat of
a fallacy.  People are different, dont always see eye to eye and have followed a different path through life.  
Kanban-Zai takes the view that this is THE ASSET that any team wants, people with a different perspective.

Where there are people there are politics.  Politics is great when out in the open.  In-fact it can generate robust
team narrative and lead to a better consensus.  More than that, politics in the open can be reined in if those politics 
become not about the team narrative.

When politics becomes subversive and not openly disscussed it can very quickly erode trust and objectivity because 
a part of the team (more than one person) is now colluding against another part of the team, in the shadows.

If this happens your team is done.  The nastiness of it will ebb and flow as people leave and new people arrive. Infact
 this personel churn-over is one of the traditional metrics of determine problems in an organisation or team.  However, 
once the rot sets in it is very difficult to remove.

one of the two primary ideas behind Kanban-zai core is to protect a team from this scenario.  To protect a team 
from itself.

The second of those primary ideas is to protect the team from politics external to the team.  This is not a new idea
and many forms of agile account for this already, with varying degrees of success.

## CONTRIBUTE OR JOIN!

If you have something to add please submit a pull request. If you would like to help curate and guide Kanban-Zai then
 request to join the crew through the github team.

## IMPLEMENT

To implement Kanban-Zai in your project all you need to do is formally adopt the [Kanban-Zai core](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/modules/0-core.md) 
by creating a github repository including a valid kanban-zai.yaml file.

## EXTEND

One size does not fit all when it comes to an Software Delivery Team.  It is quite likley that you will want to or 
need to extend Kanban-Zai to better fit your team. [Extend Kanban-Zai](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/4-extend.md) will explain to you how to go about extending your implementation of Kanban-Zai.
 
## COMMITMENT

Kanban-Zai core will be continuously improved, however no minor version will ever change the meaning of the major 
version.  If there is a significant deviation in meaning the minor version will then become the next major version.

## LICENSE

If you choose to implement Kanban-Zai and wish to say you are running a Kanban-Zai project then you MUST, at a minimum, 
implement the Kanban-Zai core.

Additionally you may not modify the Kanban-Zai Core in any way, but you may extend your implementation through the 
approved methodologies described in the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not extend your implementation in any way that nullifys or alters the meaning of any part of the Kanban-Zai core.

#### PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It’s mentally tough trying to explain simplicity to people. 
They all want it to be difficult, I think. It isn’t really.
