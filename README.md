# Kanban-Zai Methodology.

Kanban-Zai (KBZ) Methodology replaces Agile Methodology.

## IMPLEMENT

To implement Kanban-Zai in your project all you need to do is formally adopt the core by creating your own 
kanban-zai.yaml file in a public code repository of your choice and specify which core module you are extending from.

## EXTEND

Add your own settings, modules and norms to that kanban-zai file and you are running a Kanban-Zai team.

## CONTRIBUTE OR JOIN!

If you have something to add please submit a pull request. If you would like to help curate and guide Kanban-Zai then
 request to join the crew through the github team.

## COMMITMENT

Kanban-Zai core will be continuously improved, however no minor version will ever change the meaning of the major 
version.  If there is a significant deviation in meaning the minor version will then become the next major version.

Any changes to any version of the core will be done conservatively and as a result of robust debate.

## LICENSE

If you choose to implement Kanban-Zai and wish to say you are running a Kanban-Zai project then you MUST, at a minimum, 
implement the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not modify the Kanban-Zai Core in any way, but you may extend your implementation through the 
approved methodologies described in the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not extend your implementation in any way that nullifies or alters the meaning of any part of the Kanban-Zai core.

Breaching any part of this license revokes your right to publicly declare, any endeavour you undertake, as Kanban-Zai.

This license applies to all legal and illegal entities including but not limited to individual people, companies, 
partnerships, sole traders, dogs called max, Artificial Intelligences, movie producers...I don't know...you name it, 
it applies.

In light of the above please note that the Kanban-Zai core is an open source framework that you may contribute to via 
a pull request in github or by joining the Kanban-Zai core team.

#### PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It’s mentally tough trying to explain simplicity to people. 
They all want it to be difficult, I think. It isn’t really.

    These people, over the years, provided some of the inspiration behind the creation of Kanban-Zai,
    and they probably have no idea about that fact.
