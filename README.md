## IMPLEMENT

To implement Kanban-Zai in your project all you need to do is formally adopt the Kanban-Zai core by creating a version 
repository including the version of Kanban-Zai core that you are adopting in the read me.  

## EXTEND

One size does not fit all when it comes to an execution team.  It is quite likley that you will want to or need to
extend the Kanban-Zai core you better fit your team.

## COMMITMENT

Kanban-Zai core will be continuously improved, however no minor version will ever change the meaning of the major 
version.  If there is a significant deviation in meaning the minor version will then become the next major version.

## LICENSE

If you choose to implement Kanban-Zai and wish to say you are running a Kanban-Zai project then you MUST, at a minimum, 
implement the Kanban-Zai core.

Additionally you may not modify the Kanban-Zai Core in any way, but you may extend your implementation through the 
approved methodologies described in the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not extend your implementation in any way that nullifys or alters the meaning of any part of the Kanban-Zai core.

#### PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It’s mentally tough trying to explain simplicity to people. 
They all want it to be difficult, I think. It isn’t really.
