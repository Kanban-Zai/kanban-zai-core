# Triage Kanban-Zai

## Sprint

Please note that this is the ONLY performance metric Kanban-Zai enforces.  The reasoning behind this is as follows...

If a team is planning 1 sprints worth of work and completing that weeks worth of work each week then that is the measure
of a team that is functioning well.  

Backporting is included as a normal part of this metric as backporting has an explanation, and a solution attached.  

From here we can infer 3 things.

1. If cards are being planned and completed by sprint end.  The project timeline can be predicted with 
deterministic variance.
2. If backporting is happening there is a problem with the product model.
3. If cards are not being completed and not being backported there is a fundamental problem with the team.

Product model problems include
- functional granularity issues. ( too much or not enough )
- business rule conflicts
- market fit/business rule/technology conflicts


The fundamental problems are 
 - Prioritization Failures
 - Under resourcing
 - cliques
 - unaccounted scope creep
 - context switching
 - budget
 - broken trust
 - broken objectivity
