# CULTURE

It is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it, are able 
to do so.  To that end there is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  There are 
guidelines on how a teams culture can avoid colliding with the core principles of Kanban-Zai.

* It is also important to understand that the purpose of Kanban-Zai is not to dictate to a team about how they 
should act and behave, how they should code, if they should test and why they should not be a silo.
* Adopting Kanban-Zai should not impose a cultural change upon your team.  You work how you work, 
you like what you like, you reap what you sow.
* Kanban-Zai should be thought of as the glue that binds disparte parts of the puzzle together
* Most importantly Kanban-Zai presents an objective perspective to all members of the team.

## The Prime Directive

"Follow The Process"!  The Kanban-Zai process can be thought of as a cybernetic algorithm.  It is a process that lets
computers do the things they are good at and humans do the things that they are good at.

## Kanban-Zai is NOT magic.

It is the humans that provide the power to the process.  They can only do that if individual efforts are 
collectively, focused through the lens of the process.  Said another way, team members must WANT to be working on 
a Kanban-Zai team.


## People are people

People fail, are unreliable, don't communicate well, feel they are not up to the task, like to blame others, make
mistakes, do things wrong, have lives outside the team and are not robots.  Get used to it, and extend your teams
adoption of Kanban-Zai to accomodate the quirks of your current team.  If your team changes, you may have to modify
your implementation.

## Your opinion does not matter.  At All.

Your VOICE on the other hand matters a-lot!  No team can function without information.  The only place a team can get 
expert information from is other team members.  That's actually the whoe point of a team.  

Therefore All team members must offer up information.  

A balance must be struck however, because when a team has members who have an existing rapport the information exchange 
between them can be very high, however other members of the team may not get the same amount of information from the 
exact same conversation.  conversely, new team members may be saying a lot but not relaying much information to anyone
 or worse may be going over ground everybody just covered.  

The ultimate outcome of any information flow throughout the team is consensus and consensus cannot be said to have been
reached if some voting participants don't know what they are voting for.

## Make information accessible

A team must work hard on this aspect of culture. otherwise all team members are not equal participants in the team and
it is very important that all members have equal standing.  Some may be less experienced with the subject matter or
less skilled in some aspect of the project or have entireley different skills than others.  Or they might speak French.

Regardless they must all have access to the same information, the same reasoning and the same goal set as everyone else.

# Hints and tips

Listed are annecdotal experiences and general wisdom and thinking from society as a whole to help you along your 
cultural journey.

* reinforce reliability as a cultural value, most reliability issues between people can be boiled down to poor 
  communication, which is easily fixed
* Be ok with failure, do it often
* Be proactive about genuinley and generously giving credit to others
* Don't let blame blind you
* Don't wait to share bad news or ask for help
* Don't surprise people with decisions or problems out of the blue
* Don't surprise people, full stop.

### This is how you destroy a team real quick!

Trust is hard, once broken it is hard to fix.  This document does not address a personality that is hostile to 
the team.  Hostile personalites like this usually do not exist within a team and are generally a threat from without
 easy to spot and as long as the process is being followed, managable.

Problems that tear down teams all come from the inside, and most times nobody even is aware of it happening until
it is too late, if they even see it at all.

To keep it simple Kanban-Zai and categorizes these internal problems into 2 groups.

1. Anybody who favours their own view over the teams and has an inability or unwilliness to negotiate a consensus.
    
2. Anybody who chooses to not adhere to the process, including team norms, forms a clique 
(political collusion, a problem because now 1 person has > 1 votes) or surprises the team regularly.
    
Both of these can be addressed and corrected by the normal team process and by highlighting the problems.  Both of these
things will happen from time to time and generally they are part of normal human behaviour and not intentionally 
neafarious.  Inaction can let these behaviours take on a life of their own so action must be taken quickly however it
must not be personal.  Personally calling out a person on such behaviours are actually an attack on the team as they 
build resentment.

The Kanban-Zai way to deal with both situations is to record a sanction.


## Other non sanctional behaviours that are more appropriatley addressed through team norms.
* Multiple hat wearers.
* Isolation and silos.
* Abuse of goodwill.
* Overly enthusiastic people.
* People affected to much by impostor syndrome - causes very defensive behaviours
* People not affected enough by impostor syndrome - causes very offensive behaviours
