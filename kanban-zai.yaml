    what: A audit is merely a record of team consensus.  It is not an indicator of punishment it just
    represents when a team member, for any reason, deviated from the restrictions of Kanban-Zai.  All team members
    past and present must be recorded. It should never be recorded in here why a team member is working for you
    currently or no longer working for you.
