# Card sizing

Sizing is different on every team and changes over time.  Kanban-Zai recognises this
and does not impose a particular method of sizing work.  Choose the one the best suits.

However you must choose one of the following settings.

# Time

Generally cards will be broken down into small chunks and pointed in time

# Story Points

Fibbonaci sequence pointing

# Tee-Shirt Sizing

 This setting enforces the t-shirt sizing of cards - xs, s, m, l, xl
