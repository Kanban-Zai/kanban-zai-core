# Predictions

    Determines wether or not the team will target deadlines strictly or loosley.
    
    * LOOSE - Prioritizes larger chunks of the idea for consideration and more time in the ideation phase leading to 
              clearer goals in  the execution phase.
    * STRICT - Prioritizes smaller chunks of the idea for consideration and less time in the ideation phase but 
              potentially longer time in the execution phase.
